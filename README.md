A neural network model to categorize the submersible pump impeller casts as defective or not and classify the defect into type of defect. <br>
● The model used here is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the activation function used is Relu. <br>
● A detection and type classification model both using CNN are integrated into one single model. <br>
● Defect detection has a 94% accuracy rate, and the type of the defect is identified with a 68% accuracy rate. <br>
● Technology used: CNN, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), OpenCV. <br>
